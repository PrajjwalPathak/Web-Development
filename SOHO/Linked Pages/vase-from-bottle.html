        What waste you need:
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Glass or plastic bottle</li>
            <li>Paint</li>
            <li>Paintbrush</li>
            <li>Masking tape (optional)</li>
         </ul>
       </p>
       <p>
        What to do out of these:
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li>Wash the bottle to clean it and remove the label.</li>
            <li>Paint the bottle in a colour of your choice.</li>
            <li>Once the paint dries, top it up with another coat of paint so the colour is opaque enough.</li>
            <li>You can also use masking tape to make patterns on the bottles.</li>
            <li>Before painting, use the tape to make the design you want.</li>
            <li>When you remove the tape after spray painting the bottle, that part will still be transparent and will look lovely.</li>
            <li>Add a flower and your bottle vase is ready to adorn your living room!  </li>
         </ol>
