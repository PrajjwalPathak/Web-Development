       <p>
        If your little child isn’t much of a reader, let him or her turn the ice cream sticks into a fighter plane instead.

        What waste you need:
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>4 ice cream sticks</li>
            <li>1 wooden clothespin</li>
            <li>Paint</li>
            <li>Eraser/Small bead</li>
            <li>Glue</li>
            <li>Scissors/Cutter</li>
         </ul>
       </p>
       <p>
        What to do out of these:
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li>Wash and dry the ice cream sticks.</li>
            <li>Paint the sticks as well as the clothespin in any colour you please and let them dry.</li>
            <li>Cut an ice cream stick into 3 pieces and join two end pieces in a straight line with glue. This is to make the plane’s propeller.</li>
            <li>Cut a tiny little bit of the eraser, paint it and leave it aside to dry or you can simply use a small bead.</li>
            <li>Glue 2 ice cream sticks to the clothespin, perpendicular and equidistant from each other.</li>
            <li>Flip to the other side of the clip and repeat the same process with 2 more ice cream sticks, so that they overlap each other</li>
            <li>Glue the eraser or bead to the ice cream stick so that the propeller is complete!</li>
            <li>Finally, stick the propeller on the mouth of the clothespin. Your plane is ready!</li>
         </ol>
